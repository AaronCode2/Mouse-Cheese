# Mouse Cheese

Hi I'm making a Game using Raylib library and C++ for the development.  
This game is a hard-hitting flappy bird type game with the adventure of getting the highest score! `Aim high is what they say!`


## How To clone Project

### The Git Way

1. Install Git
2. Run the following command in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/AaronCode2/Mouse-Cheese.git
```

### The Zipper Way

1. Hopefully you know how to install stuff from your browser  
2. Click on this [link](https://github.com/AaronCode2/Mouse-Cheese/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to download  
3. Once downloaded, go to the directory you installed the project.
4. Then right click and Extract it.
5. Place the extracted version of the project in the directory you want.  
6. It is safe to delete the compressed Zip File / Folder

## How To Compile Project
### Hopefully you have a **C++ Compiler**, **Make**, **CMake** and **VSCode** installed to work

1. Download as a Zip or use Git
2. Open the Project with Vscode and install the C/C++ Extension Pack
3. It should come with a option of what Compiler to use, use the compiler that fits you (a GCC is recommended)
4. Once done, open the Terminal in the project directory or you could use the built-in one in Vscode.
5. Check if Cmake has created the build file or you have done it wrong ‚ùå
6. Type this command

```
cmake --build build
```

### Don't have a Compiler?
#### No Worries!

Well you will have to wait until I release the Game but once I do, do these steps.  
Game::Released = True  

1. Go to the Releases and click on TinyWonder.zip.  
2. Once downloaded, go to the directory you installed the game.
3. Then right click and Extract it.
4. Place the extracted version of the game in the directory you want.  
5. It is safe to delete the compressed Zip File / Folder
